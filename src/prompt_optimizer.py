Some potential decor items and colors that are suitable include but are not limited to:

You should take many of the decor items. You should add posters to the walls, items on desks, additional chairs and tables and rugs to fill floor space.
Clocks on the walls. Monitors or TVs on tables. Stools.
The output should be photorealistic and high-quality. Try to avoid moving or removing objects already present in the image.
